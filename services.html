         This book provides setup instructions for all the relevant software, including package managers, build tools, Python, NumPy, SciPy, OpenCV, OpenNI, and SensorKinect. The setup instructions are tailored for Windows XP or later versions, Mac OS 10.6 (Snow Leopard) or later versions, and Ubuntu 12.04 or later versions. Other Unix-like operating systems should work too, if you are willing to do your own tailoring of the setup steps. You need a webcam for the core project described  in the book. For additional features, some variants of the project use a second webcam or even an OpenNI-compatible depth camera, such as Microsoft Kinect or Asus Xtion PRO.
